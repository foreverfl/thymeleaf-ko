title: Standard URL Syntax
---


The Thymeleaf standard dialects --called *Standard* and *SpringStandard*--
offer a way to easily create URLs in your web applications so that they
include any required *URL preparation* artifacts. This is done by means
of the so-called *link expressions*, a type of *Thymeleaf
Standard Expression*: `@{...}`


Absolute URLs
-------------

Absolute URLs allow you to create links to other servers. They start by
specifying a protocol name (`http://` or `https://`)

```html
<a th:href="@{http://www.thymeleaf/documentation.html}">
```

They are not modified at all (unless you have an _URL Rewriting_ filter
configured at your server and performing modifications at the
`HttpServletResponse.encodeUrl(...)` method):

```html
<a href="http://www.thymeleaf/documentation.html">
```


Context-relative URLs
---------------------

The most used type of URLs are *context-relative* ones. These are URLs
which are supposed to be relative to the web application root once it is
installed on the server. For example, if we deploy a `myapp.war` file
into a Tomcat server, our application will probably be accessible as
`http://localhost:8080/myapp`, and `myapp` will be the *context name*.

Context-relative URLs start with `/`:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/list}">
```

If our app is installed at `http://localhost:8080/myapp`, this URL will
output:

```html
<a href="/myapp/order/list">
```


Server-relative URLs
--------------------

*Server-relative* URLs are very similar to *context-relative* URLs,
except they do not assume you want your URL to be linking to a resource
inside your application's context, and therefore allow you to link to a
different context in the same server:

```html
<a th:href="@{~/billing-app/showDetails.htm}">
```

The current application's context will be ignored, therefore although
our application is deployed at `http://localhost:8080/myapp`, this URL
will output:

```html
<a href="/billing-app/showDetails.htm">
```


Protocol-relative URLs
----------------------

*Protocol-relative* URLs are in fact absolute URLs which will keep the
protocol (HTTP, HTTPS) being used for displaying the current page. They
are typically used for including external resources like styles,
scripts, etc.:

```html
<script th:src="@{//scriptserver.example.net/myscript.js}">...</script>
```

...which will render unmodified (except for *URL rewriting*), like:

```html
<script src="//scriptserver.example.net/myscript.js">...</script>
```


Adding parameters
-----------------

How do we add parameters to the URLs we create with `@{...}`
expressions? Simple:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/details(id=3)}">
```

Which would output as:

```html
<a href="/order/details?id=3">
```

You can add several parameters, separating them with commas:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/details(id=3,action='show_all')}">
```

Which would output as:

```html
<!-- Note ampersands (&) should be HTML-escaped in tag attributes... -->
<a href="/order/details?id=3&amp;action=show_all">
```

You can also include parameters in the form of _path variables_ similarly
to _normal_ parameters but specifying a placeholder inside your URL's path:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/{id}/details(id=3,action='show_all')}">
```

Which would output as:

```html
<a href="/order/3/details?action=show_all">
```



URL fragment identifiers
------------------------

Fragment identifiers can be included in URLs, both with and without
parameters. They will always be included at the URL base, so that:

```html
<a th:href="@{/home#all_info(action='show')}">
```

...would output as:

```html
<a href="/home?action=show#all_info">
```


URL rewriting
-------------

Thymeleaf allows you to configure _URL rewriting filters_ in your application,
and it does so by calling the `response.encodeURL(...)` method in the
`javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse` class of the Servlet API for every
URL generated from a Thymeleaf template.

This is the standard way of supporting URL rewriting operations in Java web
applications, and allows URLs to:

-   Automatically detect whether the user has cookies enabled or not,
    and add the `;jsessionid=...` fragment to the URL if not ---or if it
    is the first request and cookie configuration is still unknown.
-   Automatically apply proxy configuration to URLs when needed.
-   Make use (if configured so) of different CDN (Content Delivery Network)
    setups, in order to link to content distributed among several servers.

A very common (and recommended) technology for URL Rewriting is
[URLRewriteFilter](http://tuckey.org/urlrewrite/).


Only for th:href's?
-------------------

Do not think URL `@{...}` expressions are only used in `th:href`
attributes. They can, in fact, be used *anywhere* just like variable
expressions (`${...}`) or message externalization / internationalization
ones (`#{...}`).

For example, you could use them in forms...

```html
<form th:action="@{/order/processOrder}">
```

...or as a part of other expression. Here as a parameter of an
externalized/internationalized string:

```html
<p th:text="#{orders.explanation('3', @{/order/details(id=3,action='show_all')})}">
```


Using expressions in URLs
-------------------------

What if we needed to write an URL expression like this:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/details(id=3,action='show_all')}">
```

...but neither `3` nor `'show_all'` could be literals, because we only
know their value at run time?

No problem! Every URL parameter value is in fact an expression, so you
can easily substitute your literals with any other expressions,
including i18n, conditionals...:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/details(id=${order.id},action=(${user.admin} ? 'show_all' : 'show_public'))}">
```

What's more: an URL expression like:

```html
<a th:href="@{/order/details(id=${order.id})}">
```

...is in fact a shortcut for:

```html
<a th:href="@{'/order/details'(id=${order.id})}">
```

Which means that the URL base itself can be specified as an expression,
for example a variable expression:

```html
<a th:href="@{${detailsURL}(id=${order.id})}">
```

...or an externalized/internationalized text:

```html
<a th:href="@{#{orders.details.localized_url}(id=${order.id})}">
```

...even complex expressions can be used, including conditionals, for
example:

```html
<a th:href="@{(${user.admin}? '/admin/home' : ${user.homeUrl})(id=${order.id})}">
```

Want it cleaner? Use `th:with`:

```html
<a th:with="baseUrl=(${user.admin}? '/admin/home' : ${user.homeUrl})"
  th:href="@{${baseUrl}(id=${order.id})}">
```

...or...

```html
<div th:with="baseUrl=(${user.admin}? '/admin/home' : ${user.homeUrl})">
  ...
  <a th:href="@{${baseUrl}(id=${order.id})}">...</a>
  ...
</div>
```
